                            I made this artwork in order to have some form of visual for a homeland of a character I had created. He is supposed to live within some form of mangrove, but not within a swamp. Coupled with sheer greenery, this created a sense of liveliness within the environment.

                    This is a project that I made while I was in my "Simulations and Worldbuilding" class, where we focused on creating a world and simulating it through a lens of a media. I decided to do a website, since I think it would be an interesting form to frame this world.
                    <br>Essentially, it is a database of "manifestations" - entities that have exited through a rift which are spawned out of human consciousness. It is mainly themed around the Jung's "collective unconscious", as well as merging that idea with the fact that the ocean is one that we do not fully know about.

        Welcome to the Defrosting development page. This project is currently on its very early 
        stages (ideation/concept designing the areas and characters), but I aim to have a 
        working early prototype sometime around either the end of 2025, or early 2026.

            For the concepts I have came up with, most of them are currently in my books, which

            features would allow me to easily replicate them when I have to eventually animate
            them, as well as designing their movesets, since I plan to have a combat system.

        <p> The two sketches above are the environmental concepts that I have came up with
            the setting's "core" and one of the seven areas, which I have "Jupiter" as its 
            codename. For the "core", it is basically where the planet's core is, not too
            dissimilar to our own Earth's core. I am still playing around whether the core itself
            is something different (like a star, which is improbable but interesting for it to
            be implemented) or not, but the huge gist of the world is that the core is slowly
            dying off, the planet being unable to give itself and its surface heat needed for
            those on the surface to survive.<br><br>
            For "Jupiter", with Gustav Holst's "Jupiter, Bringer of Jollity", as well as its historical
            inspirations, I aimed for this area to me more grandiose and antique, in a sense.

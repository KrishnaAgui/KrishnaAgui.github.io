                            This artwork was first created by a vision of red crystals. At the time, I was not exactly sure on what it was, until I created a world revolving around it.

                            Part of my Studio Arts work, this was inspired by the idea of liberty and freedom. I took inspiration from Frank Frazetta and Eugene Delacroix in particular to their paintings. It is paired with "Tyranny".

                            Part of my Studio Arts work, this was inspired by oppression and tyranny. Mostly taking inspiration from mainly Frank Frazetta, this piece is paired with "Liberty."

                            This was around the time I was playing Lobotomy Corporation, a game about managing a facility with entities called Abnormalities, which are born from human consciousness. This one is inspired by the Black Forest within the game, where three bird-like abnormalities come from. I aimed to capture its eerieness.

                            Based on my own version of Flight Rising's world, this was a depiction of one of my own dragons, Aeolus. The winds and air are the focus, since he is a wind elemental dragon, focused on other's freedom.

                            A commissioned artwork of an online user's (UniKorpi20) character. The keyword they gave me was a "dreamscape forest", so I focused more on the mystical and "ghostly" entities surrounding the character, as well as them interacting with one.
